{- | Removes any whitespace characters that are present at the start
or end of a string. Does not alter the internal contents of a
string. If no whitespace characters are present at the start or end
of a string, returns the original string unmodified. Safe to use on
any string.

Note that this may differ from some other similar
functions from other authors in that:

1. If multiple whitespace
characters are present all in a row, they are all removed;

2. If no
whitespace characters are present, nothing is done.

Haskell regular expression pattern. -}

## Session State

- each HTTP request should carry enough information by itself for its recipient
  to process it 
- whole idea of session is to make stateful applications using stateless
  protocol (HTTP) and dumb client (web browser), by maintaining the state on
server's side 
- Truly RESTful application would maintain state on client's side, sending all
  the necessary variables over by HTTP, preferably in the URI
